---

### 3. Paste and Execute the Script

Example loader script:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluelockhub/scripts/main/rivalsloader.lua"))()
```

This will open a GUI with toggles such as:

## 🧪 Sample Code Snippet (Educational Only)

Here’s an example of a basic auto shoot system:

```lua
local Ball = workspace:FindFirstChild("SoccerBall")
local Goal = workspace:FindFirstChild("OpponentGoal")

while wait(0.5) do
    if Ball and Goal then
        Ball.CFrame = Goal.CFrame * CFrame.new(0, 0, -5)
        game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Events.Kick:FireServer("PowerShot")
    end
end
```

This basic snippet moves the ball toward the goal and triggers a power kick. Real scripts are far more advanced with anti-ban and aim prediction.
